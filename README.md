# Arcade Database for MiSTer

  

The ArcadeDatabase_[MiSTer](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Wiki_MiSTer/wiki) repo contains files and lists about the different arcade core MRAs that are available for MiSTer.

  

# How to contribute

To make it easier for users to contribute, we now have automation.

If you want to add or update entries in the database, follow these simple steps:

  

1. Download the current CSV file from the repository.

  

2. Edit it locally with your changes (you can import it to excel if you want to, just note the delimiter we use is comma).

  

3. Upload your modified CSV file to the ArcadeDatabase_CSV folder and make a pull request.

  

4. Once your CSV file is uploaded and the pull request is merged, the automation script will process it and update the database accordingly.

  

# Naming convention

Since it is important to know exactly what version of the game you play, I've decided to go for the following naming convention:

Game Name (Country, Version) [bl/hb].

Country should follow the [Alpha-2](https://www.iban.com/country-codes) country code.

[bl] means Bootleg

[hb] means Homebrew

  

# Preferred version

As you might've noticed, there are different versions/clones of the same game. Sometimes the preferred version is documented, and sometimes it is not. Basic rule of thumb is the following (from MAME doc):

  

```

- Prefer latest release version

- Prefer English language

- Prefer most widespread release

- Prefer most complete version

- Prefer versions that are uncensored, and have story/cutscenes intact

- Prefer versions that keep the original gameplay balance

- Prefer releases from original developers/publishers rather than licensees

- Prefer releases without region-specific notices or warnings
