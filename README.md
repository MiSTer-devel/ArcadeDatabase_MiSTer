# Naming convention
Since it is important to know exactly what version of the game you play, I've decided to go for the following naming convention:  
Game Name (Country, Version) [bl/hb].  
Country should follow the [Alpha-2](https://www.iban.com/country-codes) country code.  
bl means Bootleg  
hb means Homebrew

# Preferred version
As you might've noticed, there are different versions/clones of the same game. Sometimes the preferred version is documented, and sometimes it is not. Basic rule of thumb is the following (from MAME doc):

```
- Prefer latest release version
- Prefer English language
- Prefer most widespread release
- Prefer most complete version
- Prefer versions that are uncensored, and have story/cutscenes intact
- Prefer versions that keep the original gameplay balance
- Prefer releases from original developers/publishers rather than licensees
- Prefer releases without region-specific notices or warnings
```
