# MiSTer_Arcade_Database

The MiSTer_Arcade_Database repo contains files and list about the different arcade core MRAs that are available for MiSTer. The purpose of this database is to be used with the [Arcade Organizer script](https://github.com/theypsilon/_arcade-organizer "Arcade Organizer script") that [theypsilon](https://github.com/theypsilon/_arcade-organizer "theypsilon") has created. While the name is MiSTer_ArcadeDatabase, it could be used with any application that uses some sort of an organizer script.
