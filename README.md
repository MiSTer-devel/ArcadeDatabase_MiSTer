# Arcade Database

The [MiSTer](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Wiki_MiSTer/wiki) Arcade Database repo contains files and lists about the different arcade core MRAs that are available for MiSTer. The purpose of this database is to be used with the [Arcade Organizer script](https://github.com/theypsilon/arcade-organizer "Arcade Organizer script") that [theypsilon](https://github.com/theypsilon "theypsilon") has created. While the name is MiSTer Arcade Database, it could be used with any application that uses some sort of an organizer script.

Anything missing in the database or have a suggestion? Create an issue ticket.

I'm in the process of automating so that whoever wants to contribute to the project is only required to edit the CSV file and make a pull request.

Don't like the structure of the database and want to use your own MAD database? Here is a guide on how to do it: https://github.com/theypsilon/MAD_Database_MiSTer

# Naming convention
Since it is important to know exactly what version of the game you play, I've decided to go for the following naming convention:  
Game Name (Country, Version) [bl/hb].  
Country should follow the [Alpha-2](https://www.iban.com/country-codes) country code.  
bl means Bootleg  
hb means Homebrew

# Preferred version
As you might've noticed, there are different versions/clones of the same game. Sometimes the preferred version is documented, and sometimes it is not. Basic rule of thumb is the following (from MAME doc):

```
- Prefer latest release version
- Prefer English language
- Prefer most widespread release
- Prefer most complete version
- Prefer versions that are uncensored, and have story/cutscenes intact
- Prefer versions that keep the original gameplay balance
- Prefer releases from original developers/publishers rather than licensees
- Prefer releases without region-specific notices or warnings
```
