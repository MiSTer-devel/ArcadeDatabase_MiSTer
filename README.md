# MiSTer_Arcade_Database

The MiSTer_Arcade_Database repo contains files and list about the different arcade core MRAs that are available for MiSTer. The purpose of this database is to be used with the [Arcade Organizer script](https://github.com/theypsilon/_arcade-organizer "Arcade Organizer script") that [theypsilon](https://github.com/theypsilon/_arcade-organizer "theypsilon") has created. While the name is MiSTer_ArcadeDatabase, it could be used with any application that uses some sort of an organizer script.

# Naming convension
Since it is importaint to know exactly what version of the game you play, I've decided to go for the following naming convension </br> </br> Game Name (Country, Version) [bl/hb]. </br> </br>
Country should follow the [Alpha-2](https://www.iban.com/country-codes) country code.
</br>
bl means Bootleg
</br>
hb means Homebrew

# Prefered version
As you might've noticed, there are different versions/clones of the same game. Sometimes the prefered version is documented, and sometimes it is not. The basic rule of thumb is the following (from MAME doc):

```
- Prefer latest release version

--Prefer English language

- Prefer most widespread release

- Prefer most complete version

- Prefer versions that are uncensored, and have story/cutscenes intact

- Prefer versions that keep the original gameplay balance

- Prefer releases from original developers/publishers rather than licensees

- Prefer releases without region-specific notices or warnings
```
